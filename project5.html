        <p>The aim of this project is to determine the best location for a small wind farm on Banks Peninsula.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The farm will consist of five 500kW wind turbines mounted on 70 m tall towers. </li>
            <li>This would provide enough electricity to supply the needs of around 600 households - roughly the whole population in the study area!</li>
            <li>The three most suitable preliminary locations for a five turbine wind farm. </li>
            <li>The visual and noise impacts will be evaluated and a final choice for the best site will be made and recommended.</li>
        </ul>
