        <p>The purpose of this analysis was to locate potential areas for solar farm sites in Ashburton District, particularly focusing on livestock farmland. Geographic Information System (GIS) was used as a tool to consider multiple spatial criteria and constraint factors to locate potential areas for solar farm.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>. Geographic Information System (GIS) was used as a tool to consider multiple spatial criteria and constraint factors to locate potential areas for solar farm. </li>
            <li>First, weighted score of selected criteria, including elevation, solar radiation, and distance to transmission lines of study area were obtained.</li>
            <li>The resulting layer was then analysed with constraint factors to exclude land types that are not low producing or high producing grassland, zones within 2000m of populated areas, and a slope greater than 5 degrees.</li>
            <li>From our analysis, 950.13km2 out of the 6,181.45 km2 of the study area were considered as highly suitable for potential solar farm locations. </li>
        </ul>
